OBJECT POOLING EXPLAINATION
Object pooling was implemented by having a Queue of ducks that can be used at any one time. Whenever a duck is needed, a duck is popped from the Queue and the gameobeject of that duck is enabled so it can fly freely. Object Pooling editor results are available in the Object Pooling folder as images. The use of object pooling helps reduce the games memory by about 10MB due to the controlled creation of GameObjects. The CPU use time is also down by about 10MS since there is no need to destroy and create gameobjects. When gameobjects can be reused, it saves computational power.

COMMAND DESIGN PATTERN EXPLAINATION
The command design pattern works by creating an abstract class called Command that has a DoAction() method. This function gets called whenever the command needs to get done. Whenever a key is pressed, a specific command's DoAction() gets triggered. The commands responsible for moving the cursor are a subset of Commands called movementCommands. These specifically control movement of the cursor. By changing the command that gets triggered, the outcome will be different. When the player misses 2 shots on the ducks, their W and S commands get set differently. Normally W makes the cursor move up and S makes the cursor move down. However, when the player misses 2 shots, the command binded to the W key gets set to move down, and the command binded to the S key gets set to move up. There is an array of size 4 that holds all the movementCommands that will be executed. The W key is linked to the movementCommand at index 0. S is linked to index 1. A is linked to index 2. D is linked to index 3. When the player misses 2 shots, the movementCommand at the indexes 0 and 1 are changed, which in turn, changes the action that gets performed when a key is pressed.
