OBJECT POOLING EXPLAINATION
Object pooling was implemented by having a Queue of ducks that can be used at any one time. Whenever a duck is needed, a duck is popped from the Queue and the gameobeject of that duck is enabled so it can fly freely. Object Pooling editor results are available in the Object Pooling folder as images.
